# PDF spike

A repository for testing various libraries for writing pdf files.

Things tried so far:
* [printpdf](https://crates.io/crates/printpdf)

  The API of this is a bit too complicated for my liking. It also doesn't have a
  built-in way of getting text width or height; that requires using another
  crate.

* [pdf-canvas](https://crates.io/crates/pdf-canvas)

  Much simpler API, seems promising so far
